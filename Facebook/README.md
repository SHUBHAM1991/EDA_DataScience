#Exploratory Data Analysis of Facebook  Data with Python

##Aim of analysis
This work is based on that performed by Chris Bow [1] which was implemented using R. The aim of this project is to convert the analysis to Python and investigate the dataset further.

##Facebook Advertising Platform
Facebook users provide Facebook with a huge wealth of information which can be used to build up a detailed profile of users personal information, habits and interests. Advertisers using Facebook as a platform for their adverts can then tailor their advertising strategy appropriately, perhaps focussing on particular groups of users with similar attributes for a particular product or concentrating on presenting different features of their product to the appropriate groups.

Optimizing the advertising strategy may well mean different things for different businesses, but in each case the end goal of any analysis is to provide actionable answers to the relevant questions which can drive business performance, however that may be measured. Common aims may be to:

improve brand awareness
improve future purchases based on adding customer lifetime value
maximise the amount of revenue returned for the minimum expenditure.
In the following the later is investigated.
