# What Is Data Science?

------------
A groundbreaking study in 2013 reported 90% of the entirety of the world’s data has been created within the previous two years. Let that sink in. In just two years, we've collected and processed 9x the amount of information than the previous 92,000 years of humankind combined. And it isn’t slowing down. It’s projected we’ve already created 2.7 zettabytes of data, and by 2020, that number will balloon to an astounding 44 zettabytes.

What do we do with all of this data? How do we make it useful to us? What are it's real-world applications? These questions are the domain of data science.

# EDA

**Exploratory data analysis (EDA) **is a very important step which takes place after feature engineering and acquiring data and it should be done before any modeling. This is because it is very important for a data scientist to be able to understand the nature of the data without making assumptions

Machine Learning is a latest __buzzword__ floating around. It desrves to, as it is one of the most interesting subfield of Computer Science.<br>
__What does Machine Learning really means?__<br>
Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence(AI) that provides systems the ability  to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.<br>
__Machine Learning focuses on the development of computer programs__ that can access data and use it to learn for themsleves.<br>
The process of learning begins with data, such as, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. __The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically__ without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.
